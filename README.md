### Hi! ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Skyler Rexroad.

I discovered programming at a young age and quickly realized it was a passion of mine. I spent several years (in my free time) participating in game jams, pursuing personal projects, and performing freelance work.

My professional career as a programmer has enhanced my existing skill set and allowed me the opportunity to apply my talents and create informative, intuitive, and beautiful applications.
